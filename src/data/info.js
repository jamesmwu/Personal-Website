			"During my internship, I took on the challenge of independently implementing a new feature to detect dynamically linked libraries (DLL) in customers' applications, providing vital insights into potential vulnerabilities. This feature was successfully deployed and is currently being used in production, delivering significant value to our customers. To complement this functionality, I built a responsive and accessible user interface, leveraging Angular.js and custom GraphQL queries. The interface incorporated sorting and filtering functionalities based on architecture, path, or platform, allowing users to analyze the results within the application efficiently. Additionally, I introduced a TypeScript service to detect window resize changes in the product dashboard, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen dimensions. As part of optimizing the development process, I modified the configuration file code, resulting in a remarkable 94% improvement in development build times and reducing refresh speeds from 50 seconds to just 3 seconds.",

Our organization received International recognition from the Association of Computing Machinery for its exceptional contribution to the academic, professional, and personal growth of students. I led a technical workshop series called "StackSchool," teaching the MERN technology stack to 100+ attendees and managing a budget of over $1000. I also directed an 8-week project-based series called "HackSpace," overseeing 100+ individuals and guiding teams in app, web, and game development, resulting in the successful completion of 7 projects. Additionally, I played a key role in maintaining the ACM Hack and HOTH websites, conducting code reviews and debugging issues. I developed curriculum and conducted beginner-friendly technical workshops on Swift, React Native, and React.js, consistently attracting an average of 200+ attendees. Through my proposal of new teaching structures involving mentorship and marketing initiatives, we achieved a remarkable 70% increase in event retention rate.',

This boosted sentiment prediction accuracy by 30% and enabled effective flagging of inappropriate comments.

			'I consider myself a talkative introvert-- I love meeting new people and having conversations, but I also enjoy vibing on my own.',
			"I have a couple ways of keeping myself mindlessly entertained. I follow the NBA (Lakers WOOO) and watch Minecraft videos. I also like playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate... my friends don't like playing with me anymore because I always beat them. But I like watching professional play and practicing the techniques they use, sometimes I'll even take notes for fun if I see something especially intriguing.",
			'Some hobbies I think are probably more stimulating that I enjoy include reading, drawing, playing my violin, working out, and playing basketball. Regarding the reading point, I REALLY like learning about how businesses become successful, especially tech ones. Some of my favorites include "Shoe Dog" by Phil Knight, "Unbroken" by Laura Hillenbrand, and "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien. Regarding the drawing point, I usually draw digital art, but I also like drawing on whiteboards... if that counts? For some reason I really enjoy drawing nature stuff that is devoid of people or human influence. So stuff like mountains, clouds, forests, etc. But I mostly just draw little doodles and more derpy looking stuff.',
			"My idea of fun is chilling comfortably with friends, playing board games or cards or just chatting. I feel like in college there tends to be more of a party scene, but it's never really been for me I think."

			"I immensely enjoy SWE for the practicality and creativity it offers. I think it's difficult to find any other profession where you can create something that can be used by thousands of people, all from one dude coding something in his bedroom. I was initially pursuing mechanical engineering, and I'll just say that it might be a little harder to solder something together or manufacture a car while sitting at your personal desk.",
			"In addition to that, I really enjoy learning the actual concepts and processes involved in building software. I think it's fascinating to see how all the different parts of a program come together to create something that can be used by others.",
			'My goal is to build something interesting and cool that will positively impact people, and I think SWE is a great way to do that.'

		title: '📖 My Background:',
		description: [
			'In elementary school, I was fascinated by the idea of creating new worlds and ideas that had never been seen before! So naturally, I wanted to be... an author. I enjoyed reading and I enjoyed writing, so it seemed like the perfect fit. I would frequently handwrite my stories and present the stapled bundles of paper for my parents to read.',
			"Eventually, my aspirations shifted. In high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do and tried out every available opportunity. In addition to a variety of extracurriculars (violin, orchestra, basketball, cross country), I found myself getting into speech. I enjoyed debate, participated in mock trial, did some work for the school paper, won some speech competitions, and even gave a TEDx talk. I thought going into law or politics might be the move.",
			"But after some research, I realized law wasn't for me, and politics maybe was not so fun.",
			'I decided to apply to colleges as a mechanical engineering major, as I liked the idea of engineering-- building stuff to help others sounded pretty cool, and I always enjoyed learning about how stuff worked. Later in the year, taking AP CSA, I realized programming was actually kind of fun, and I ended up making an app with some friends. Around this time, the first thoughts of a potential career in software engineering started to form.',
			'Once I began college at UCLA, I took my first year to explore. I was in 5 clubs at one point, and decided to sample every type of engineering. I was in an electrical engineering club, a mechanical engineering club, a civil engineering club, and a computer science club. Out of the work that all of them did, I found I enjoyed CS the most (for the reasons mentioned in the "Thoughts on CS" section above). Plus, the community of the CS club-- ACM Hack-- was amazing. I met so many awesome people, and I loved building stuff with them. A year later, I\'m now a computer science major and more involved in Hack than ever.',
			"Now, as I continue to develop my skills and explore CS, I'm excited to see where my journey will go."
