			'As the President of the UCLA Association of Computing Machinery Hack committee, I successfully managed a team of 20 officers and a budget of $4000, organizing events and technical projects throughout the year for over 700 members. Our organization received International recognition from the Association of Computing Machinery for its exceptional contribution to the academic, professional, and personal growth of students. I led a technical workshop series called "StackSchool," teaching the MERN technology stack to 100+ attendees and managing a budget of over $1000. I also directed an 8-week project-based series called "HackSpace," overseeing 100+ individuals and guiding teams in app, web, and game development, resulting in the successful completion of 7 projects. Additionally, I played a key role in maintaining the ACM Hack and HOTH websites, conducting code reviews and debugging issues. I developed curriculum and conducted beginner-friendly technical workshops on Swift, React Native, and React.js, consistently attracting an average of 200+ attendees. Through my proposal of new teaching structures involving mentorship and marketing initiatives, we achieved a remarkable 70% increase in event retention rate.',

			"During my internship, I took on the challenge of independently implementing a new feature to detect dynamically linked libraries (DLL) in customers' applications, providing vital insights into potential vulnerabilities. This feature was successfully deployed and is currently being used in production, delivering significant value to our customers. To complement this functionality, I built a responsive and accessible user interface, leveraging Angular.js and custom GraphQL queries. The interface incorporated sorting and filtering functionalities based on architecture, path, or platform, allowing users to analyze the results within the application efficiently. Additionally, I introduced a TypeScript service to detect window resize changes in the product dashboard, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen dimensions. As part of optimizing the development process, I modified the configuration file code, resulting in a remarkable 94% improvement in development build times and reducing refresh speeds from 50 seconds to just 3 seconds.",

			'During my software engineering internship, I successfully built the user interface of a mobile app using React Native. This involved creating multiple screens, implementing in-app navigation, and designing a user feed to display all available products. I also developed user authentication and post-saving functionality, leveraging Firebase for seamless data management. Through refactoring existing code, I optimized scalability and achieved efficiency gains, putting us three months ahead of schedule. Additionally, I explored natural language processing techniques and used TensorFlow to preprocess data for a sentiment analysis machine learning model. This boosted sentiment prediction accuracy by 30% and enabled effective flagging of inappropriate comments. Collaborating with graphic designers, application testers, and product management, we deployed the app on the iOS store within a tight timeframe of four months, ensuring a successful launch.',
