# James's website

Hello! Welcome to the README of my website. Whether you are a recruiter or a friend stalking me, I'm happy to have you here. Feel free to clone the repo and glance at at the code.

## Available Scripts

These are more like just a reminder to myself, because I'd be kind of surprised if this becomes a ginormous project with hundreds of contributors.

However, because this isn't a massive scale corporation that requires many tests and careful reviews before publishing, I really only use these two following commands.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Publishes the deploy to GH pages. You can also use `$ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"` to specify a commit message.
